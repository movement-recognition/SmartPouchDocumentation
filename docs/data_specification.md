# Data Specification Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the data specifications for SmartPouch_v2.

## Data Structure

### 1. Raw Data Format
- CSV files
- JSON files
- Database records
- Sensor data streams
In the above example, the htmltitle block defined in your custom main.html file will be used in place of the default htmltitle block defined in the parent theme. You may re-define as many blocks as you desire, as long as those blocks are defined in the parent. For example, you could replace the Google Analytics script with one for a different service or replace the search feature with your own. You will need to consult the parent theme you are using to determine what blocks are available to override. The MkDocs and ReadTheDocs themes provide the following blocks:


### 2. Processed Data
- Feature vectors
- Training datasets
- Validation datasets
- Test datasets

## Data Categories

### 1. Training Data
- Labeled data for model training
- Augmented data samples
- Cross-validation splits
