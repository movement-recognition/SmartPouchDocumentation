# SmartPouch Data Experiment Overview

Welcome to the SmartPouch Experiment Center! This comprehensive guide will help you understand and make the most of SmartPouch's experimental workflow.

## What is SmartPouch?

- The Smart Pouch is a compact, sensor-equipped device designed to monitor and record the motion status of objects in logistics environments, particularly in air cargo operations. 

- It integrates accelerometers, gyroscopes, and environmental sensors to capture high-resolution time-series data, enabling real-time or post-event analysis of handling activities such as movement, vibrations, tilting, and environmental changes. 

- By attaching the Smart Pouch to cargo containers or vehicles, stakeholders can gain insights into operational processes, improve traceability, and support the development of AI-driven motion classification and anomaly detection systems.
